    You find your wife
    Sitting in a chair
    She's dead..
    Gravekeeper: This is my fault
    Gravekeeper: I left her here to die alone
    <<if visited("Wife.GetBread")>>
    Gravekeeper: And I took the bread she needed
    <<endif>>
    Gravekeeper: ...
    You fall to your knees and cry
    <<call animate("WifeDead")>>
    <<endif>>
